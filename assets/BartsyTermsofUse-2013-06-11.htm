<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment and Billing</p>

<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment and Fees. You acknowledge and agree to pay the full
price for each order you place through the Bartsy Service. Vendsy is not
responsible for any inaccurate prices displayed in the Bartsy Service. Prices
are inputted directly by the Merchant and may not include taxes. Access to the
Bartsy Service, or to certain features of the Bartsy Service, may require you to
pay fees. Before you are required to pay any fees, you will have an opportunity
to review and accept the applicable fees that you will be charged. All fees are
non-refundable. Vendsy may change the fees for the Bartsy Service or any
feature of the Bartsy Service, including by adding additional fees or charges,
on a going-forward basis at any time.</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Method of payment. Vendsy accepts payments through payment
methods detailed on the applicable payment screen, which may includes certain
credit cards. Payments made through the Bartsy Service are processed by
third-party payment processors. Charges occur at the time of purchase or
shortly thereafter. Vendsy does not accept payment forms other than those
specified on the applicable payment screen. You agree to pay for services that
you purchase through the Bartsy Service and you agree that we may charge your
selected payment method for any such payments.</p>

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Account Use. To use or register for a paid feature on the
Bartsy Service, you are required to keep payment information current, complete
and accurate (such as a change in address, credit/debit card number or
expiration date) and notify Bartsy if the selected payment method is canceled
(e.g., for loss or theft). You are responsible for all charges incurred under
your account made by you or anyone who uses your account (including your
employees, agents, independent contractors, or others who access your account).</p>

<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes. You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes
imposed on your use of the Bartsy Service, including, but not limited to,
sales, use or value-added taxes. To the extent Vendsy is obligated to collect
such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.</p>

<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp; Disputes and Refunds. When you place an order, the Bartsy
Service is solely a facilitator of communications and payments between you, as
a user of the Bartsy Service, and a Merchant. Vendsy is in no way responsible
for the quality of goods or services offered by the Merchant. You, not Vendsy,
are responsible for any orders placed in error using the Bartsy System. In the
event of a dispute between you and the Merchant over payment, the Merchant, and
not Vendsy, is fully responsible for any and all refunds agreed to between you
and the Merchant. Orders that time out will not be refunded (see clause 1)</p>

<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusal of Service by Merchant. You should be
prepared to present valid identification to the Merchant when using the Bartsy
Service to purchase alcohol. The Merchant has discretion to refuse service to
you for any reason, including but not limited to, your failure to provide
proper identification. If the Merchant refuses service to you, you still must
pay the full cost of any orders placed through the Bartsy Service unless the
Merchant agrees otherwise.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Submissions</p>

<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; General. The Bartsy Service provides certain features which
enable users to directly and indirectly post content, including text, images,
and other types of works (such as by creating a profile, placing an order than
includes your photo, or by posting reviews or uploading photos) (collectively
called, “User Submissions”), and provides for the hosting, reproduction,
distribution, transmission, public performance, and public display of such User
Submissions. User Submissions are displayed for informational purposes only and
are not controlled by Vendsy. You understand that all User Submissions are the
sole responsibility of the person from whom such User Submission originated.
This means that you, and not Vendsy, are entirely responsible for all User
Submissions that you make available through the Bartsy Service.</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; No Obligation to Publish. Vendsy makes no representations
that it will publish or make available on the Bartsy Service any User Submissions
(or that if made available on the Bartsy Service, that any User Submission will
remain available on the Bartsy Service), and reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to refuse to allow any User Submissions on the Bartsy Service, or
to remove any User Submission at any time with or without notice. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Vendsy complies with the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove User Submissions upon receipt
of a compliant takedown notice (see “Digital Millennium Copyright Act” below),
or if Vendsy becomes aware that the preparation, use, or distribution of any
such User Submission violates any law or regulation.</p>

<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License Grant by You to Vendsy. You retain ownership of
all your rights in and to your User Submissions, including any and all
intellectual property rights in your User Submissions, and uploading User
Submissions to the Bartsy Service does not transfer any ownership rights. In
order to enable us to operate the Bartsy Service, however, we do need certain
permission from you. Accordingly, by submitting User Submissions to Vendsy, you
hereby grant Vendsy and its affiliates and other users of the Bartsy Service
(the “Bartsy Licensees”) a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, and transferable license to use,
reproduce, distribute, transmit, publicly display, modify, and publicly perform
your User Submissions and adaptations thereof, solely in connection with the
development, operation, maintenance, enhancement, and promotion of the Bartsy
Service, and to collect, combine, aggregate, and analyze, data related to your
User Submissions and derivatives thereof.</p>

<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; User Submissions Representations and Warranties. You are
solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of
posting or publishing them. You affirm, represent, and warrant that i) you own,
or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and
authorize Vendsy to use your User Submissions in the manner contemplated by
these User Terms, and to grant the rights and license set forth above, and ii)
our use of such User Submissions, and our exercise of the license rights set
forth above, do not and will not: (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any
third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret,
moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual
property or proprietary right; (b) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right
of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (c)
violate any applicable law or regulation; or (d) require obtaining a license
from or paying fees or royalties to any third party for the exercise of any
rights granted in these User Terms.</p>

otherwise transferred to you. Subject to your acceptance of, and ongoing
compliance with, the User Terms (including payment of any applicable license

revocable license to (i) use the Apps on a device that you own or control; and

applicable law).</p>

<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Applicability to Upgrades. These User Terms will govern any
upgrades provided by Vendsy that replace and/or supplement the original Apps,
unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case that
license will govern.</p>

collect and use technical data and related information, including, but not limited
to, technical information about your handset, device, system and application
software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the
provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if
any) related to the Apps. Vendsy may use and disclose this and other
information you provide for a variety of purposes. To learn more about our
policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of information,

<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Third Party Fees. You understand and acknowledge that third
party fees may apply to your use of the Mobile Application, including without
limitation fees charged by your mobile service provider for network access,
data transmission, or other similar fees. You are solely responsible for all
such fees</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modification of the User Terms</p>

<p>From time to time, Vendsy may change, modify, add, or remove portions of the
User Terms, and reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. If we
modify the User Terms, we will make them available through the Bartsy Service,
and indicate the date of the latest revision. We encourage users to review the
User Terms periodically for changes. In the event that the modifications
materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder we will make reasonable
efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your
email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar
notification when you access the Bartsy Service for the first time after such
material changes are made. All amended User Terms automatically take effect 30
days after they made available through the Bartsy Service, except that (i)
disputes between you and Vendsy will be governed by the version of the User
Terms that was in effect on the date the dispute arose and (ii) if you do not
agree with any changes to the User Terms, you may terminate these User Terms by
ceasing use of the Bartsy Service. Your continued use of the Bartsy Service
after revised User Terms have become effective indicates that you have read,
understood and agreed to the current version of the User Terms.</p>

Vendsy (“Materials”) are protected by United States copyright, trade dress,
patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant

rights therein, belong to Vendsy or its affiliates and/or third party
licensors. All trademarks, service marks, and trade names are proprietary to
Vendsy or its affiliates and/or third party licensors. Except as expressly

are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says:

you provide to Coaster during the registration process. Notice by email will be

deemed given three days after the date of mailing.</p>

for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may
have with Vendsy or use of the Bartsy Service and remove and discard all or any
part of your account or any content uploaded by you, at any time. Vendsy may

your right to use the Bartsy Service at any time and for any reason or no
reason, by immediately discontinuing all use of the Bartsy Service, including
